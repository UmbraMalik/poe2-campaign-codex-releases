## What it does

POE2 Campaign Codex Overlay is a small helper for campaign runs:

- detects the current zone from the game log file;
- shows route notes for Acts 1–5;
- shows current-zone tasks and the next zone;
- tracks total time and act time;
- shows reminders for flasks, bases, power spikes, rewards, and campaign bonuses;
- provides a detailed panel with route, timers, act times, reminders, bonuses, and summary;
- supports **RU / EN** interface switching;
- supports Russian and English client log formats where mapped.

The goal is simple: make repeated campaign runs less annoying, especially for new or returning players.

## Safety / how it works

This project is designed as a **passive local overlay**.

It does **not**:

- read Path of Exile 2 process memory;
- inject into the game;
- modify the game client;
- intercept or inspect network packets;
- automate gameplay;
- send inputs to the game;
- click, type, or perform actions for the player.

It only:

- reads the game log file, such as `Client.txt` / `LatestClient.txt`, for zone and event detection;
- displays local guide data from the project files;
- draws a desktop overlay window.

The source code is public so users can inspect what the application does before running it.

## Localization

The app supports Russian and English UI.

Technical note:

- `zone_en` is used as a stable technical/matching value where needed;
- displayed zone names and guide text are localized through the i18n/data layer;
- English text should be natural English, not transliteration.

If you find text like `bossu`, `klyuchevoy`, `zapustit`, `razborki`, or any other transliteration in EN mode, please report it.

## Testing philosophy

The project has regression tests for guide data, log parsing, timers, overlay behavior, settings, links, and safety checks.

Before opening a pull request or publishing a release, run:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

For release builds:
